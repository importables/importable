# Importable

**Importable** allows you to import files with strong typing based on import attributes (_presently import assertions_).

```js
import config from './config.yml' with { type: 'yaml' }

console.assert(config.doe === 'a deer, a female deer')
```

Internally, **Importable** treats import assertions as thought they are [import attributes](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-attributes),
in anticipation of the new import assertions syntax.

Once TypeScript supports import assertions, this plugin will provide an update to support the new syntax.

## Installation

```shell
npm install importable
